Comments in PHP
	A comment in PHP code is a line that is not read/executed as part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.

Comments can be used to:

	Let others understand what you are doing
	Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code

PHP supports several ways of commenting:
 */

// This is a single-line comment <--- inline comment

# This is also a single-line comment <--- inline comment like C, C++

/* 										---
This is a multiple-lines comment block 	  | Block comments
that spans over multiple 				  |
lines 								    ---
